            I'm Nobody! Who are you?

        <p>
            you - Nobody - Too? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there's a pair of us! 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!

            How dreary - to be - Somebody!
        </p> 
        <p>
            How public - like a Frog - 
        </p>
        <p>     
            To tell one's name - the livelong June - 
        </p>
        <p>
            To an admiring Bog!
